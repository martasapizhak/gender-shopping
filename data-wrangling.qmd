There are no missing values and the dataset is overall cleaned. Some of the things we need to account for to make sure we compare apples to apples are:

- gender
- items and categories
- sales taxes
- size
- prices
- season
- subscription status + delivery type
- discounts and coupons
- age

Cols to remove:
- Frequency of Purchases
- Previous Purchases
- Preferred Payment Method
- Payment Method
- Review Rating
